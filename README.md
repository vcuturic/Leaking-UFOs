# Leaking-UFOs 
## How to Play

This is a 2-player split-screen battle game.

Both players choose a rule that their dearest enemy must not break. And **DO NOT LOOK** at what your enemy is brewing. Be just.

**Outmaneuver, outshoot, or outsmart** your opponent and if that doesn’t work, try smashing them with a hammer or blowing them up with your built-in rocket launcher, no?

**BUT BE WARY,** not all abilities are within arm’s reach. There is a **JUDGE** who will carefully consider your **misdeeds**.

- Keep moving — standing still is a recipe for disaster.
- And do not forget to collect your powerups.
